#What is Agile?
Set of values and principles the help people make software

#Origins of Agile
Software developers in the 80s and 90s experienced high levels of failed projects & noticed some common traits:
•	Too much analysis upfront
•	Restrictive change control
•	Too much uncertainty
So
•	Software developers collaborated and experimented with new ways of working
•	Working software over contract negotiation

#The Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
•	Individuals & interactions over processes & tools
•	Working software over comprehensive documentation
•	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
•	Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Traditional methods tend to rely more on planning and change control. Changes late in development can be perceived as unwelcome.
The View:
•	As new events unfold the project team incorporates those realities into the ongoing work
•	Changes become opportunities to add value instead of being obstacles to avoid
