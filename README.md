# What is Agile?
Set of values and principles the help people make software

# Origins of Agile
Software developers in the 80s and 90s experienced high levels of failed projects & noticed some common traits:
•	Too much analysis upfront
•	Restrictive change control
•	Too much uncertainty
So
•	Software developers collaborated and experimented with new ways of working
•	Working software over contract negotiation

# The Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
•	Individuals & interactions over processes & tools
•	Working software over comprehensive documentation
•	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
•	Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Traditional methods tend to rely more on planning and change control. Changes late in development can be perceived as unwelcome.
The View:
•	As new events unfold the project team incorporates those realities into the ongoing work
•	Changes become opportunities to add value instead of being obstacles to avoid

## SCRUM
A team based framework to develop complex systems and products
Product backlog -> Sprint Planning -> Sprint Backlog -> Daily Scrum -> Sprint Review -> Increment / Sprint Retrospective -> Sprint Planning....

## 3 Pillars of SCRUM
Working on an experience based manner so progress is based on reality, not fictionious plans
Transparency
•	Everyone presents the facts as is and collectively collaborates for the common organizational objective. No one has a hidden agenda
Inspection
•	Not done by an inspector but by everyone on the Scrum Team. The inspection can be done for the product, processes, people aspects, practices
Adaptation
•	Is about continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve

## Roles and Accountability
Scrum Team
•	Co-located
•	Engaged with the customer(s)
•	Self-Organising
•	Accountable & Empowered
•	Cross Functional
Product Owner
•	Key stakeholder who should have deep understanding of the product and communicates with both the team and other stakeholders. Is our key point of contact.
Scrum Master
•	Ensures the team keeps to the values of Scrum, facilitates meetings and removes impediments

### SCRUM Events - The Sprint
Includes
•	Planning and development work
•	Daily scrum
-	15 minute time-boxed event for the development team
-	Held everyday of the sprint
-	Focusses on progress towards the sprint goal
-	Facilitated by the Scrum master
-	So what I did yesterday that helped the team meet the Sprint Goal and what I will do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal
•	Sprint review at the end
•	Team retrospective before the next sprint
During the Sprint
•	No changes are made to endanger the Sprint goal
•	Short planning horizon (no more than 1 month ahead)
•	Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and the development team

### The different steps
Sprint Planning
Format
•	Collaborative work of the entire team
•	Timeboxed according to the duration of the sprint
Typical individual contribution
•	What work will be done in this Sprint?
•	How will the chosen work get done?
•	What is the goal of this sprint?

Sprint Review
Format
•	Informal discussion about what was done during the sprint and to adapt to the product backlog
•	Explain what has been done and what hasn’t
•	Demonstrate the working package
•	Review the timeline, budget. Capabilities
•	Timeboxed to 4 hours for a month-long Sprint or less if shorter Sprint

Sprint retrospective
Format
•	Identify what went well and what needs improvement
•	Create a plan for improvements
•	Timeboxed to 3 hours for a month-long Sprint or less if shorter Sprint
•	Things we need to start doing, need doing and keep doing

### Scrum Artefacts
SCRUM Artefacts
•	Product backlog
•	SPRINT backlog
•	Task Board
•	Burn Down Chart
•	Burn Up Chart
•	Definition of Done
